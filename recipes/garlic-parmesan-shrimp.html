    <h1>Million Dollar Chicken Recipe</h1>
    <img src="../img/garlic-parmesan0.webp" />
    <h2>Description:</h2>
    <p>
      Creamy and incredibly savory, it's a casserole that's hard to stop eating.
      The cottage cheese is the trick to getting such a creamy, melty texture.
      Using rotisserie chicken is a must for the recipe and helps keep it quick.
